# grubhub-orders CLI

A CLI for extracting customer info from Grubhub orders (emails from Grubhub with order info). 
Also works for Eatstreet.

If you have an inbox full of orders from Grubhub and would like to export customer info 
into a csv file, use Thunderbird to download all of your emails into 'data/in/All Mail' then run
```
grubhub-orders
```

Customer info will be exported into 'data/out/results.csv'
